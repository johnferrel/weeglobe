                            <h3>The boy and the apple tree</h3>
                            <p>A long time ago, there was a huge apple tree.
                                A little boy loved to come and play around it every day.
                                He climbed to the treetop, ate the apples, and took a nap under the shadow.
                                He loved the tree and the tree loved to play with him.
                                Time went by, the little boy had grown up and he no longer played around the tree every day.
                                <br />
                                One day, the boy came back to the tree and he looked sad.
                                “Come and play with me”, the tree asked the boy.
                                <br />
                                “I am no longer a kid, I don’t play around trees anymore” the boy replied.
                                “I want toys.
                                I need money to buy them.”
                                <br />
                                “Sorry, but I do not have money, but you can pick all my apples and sell them.
                                So, you will have money.”
                                <br />
                                The boy was so excited.
                                He grabbed all the apples on the tree and left happily.
                                The boy never came back after he picked the apples.
                                The tree was sad.
                                One day, the boy who now turned into a man returned and the tree was excited.
                                <br />
                                “Come and play with me” the tree said.
                                <br />
                                “I do not have time to play.
                                I have to work for my family.
                                We need a house for shelter.
                                Can you help me?”
                                <br />
                                “Sorry, but I do not have any house.
                                But you can chop off my branches to build your house.”
                                So the man cut all the branches of the tree and left happily.
                                The tree was glad to see him happy but the man never came back since then.
                                The tree was again lonely and sad.
                                One hot summer day, the man returned and the tree was delighted.
                                “Come and play with me!”
                                the tree said.
                                <br />
                                “I am getting old.
                                I want to go sailing to relax myself.
                                Can you give me a boat?”
                                said man.
                                <br />
                                “Use my trunk to build your boat.
                                You can sail far away and be happy.”
                                So the man cut the tree trunk to make a boat.
                                He went sailing and never showed up for a long time.
                                Finally, the man returned after many years.
                                “Sorry, my boy.
                                But I do not have anything for you anymore no more apples for you”, the tree said.
                                <br />
                                “No problem, I do not have any teethe to bite and I know no more trunk to climb on, I am too
                                old” the man replied.
                                <br />
                                “I really cannot give you anything, the only thing left is my dying roots,”
                                the tree said with tears.
                                <br />
                                “I do not need much now, just a place to rest.
                                I am tired after all these years,”
                                the man replied.
                                “Good!
                                Old tree roots are the best place to lean on and rest, come sit down with me and rest.”
                                The man sat down and the tree was glad and smiled with tears.
                                <br />
                                This is a story of everyone.
                                The tree is like our parents.
                                When we were young, we loved to play with our Mum and Dad.
                                When we grow up, we leave them;
                                only come to them when we need something or when we are in trouble.
                                No matter what, parents will always be there and give everything they could just to make you
                                happy.
                                You may think the boy is cruel to the tree, but that is how all of us treat our parents.
                                We take them for granted;
                                we don’t appreciate all they do for us, until it’s too late.
                            </p>

                            <p>Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson go on a camping trip, set up their tent, and fall asleep.
                            Some hours later, Holmes wakes his faithful friend.
                            <br />
                            - Watson, look up at the sky and tell me what you see.
                            <br />
                            Watson replies, - I see millions of stars.
                            <br />
                            - What does that tell you?
                            <br />
                            Watson ponders for a minute.
                            <br />
                            - Astronomically speaking, it tells me that there are millions of galaxies and potentially billions of planets.
                            Astrologically, it tells me that Saturn is in Leo.
                            Timewise, it appears to be approximately a quarter past three.
                            Theologically, it's evident the Lord is all-powerful and we are small and insignificant.
                            Meteorologically, it seems we will have a beautiful day tomorrow.
                            What does it tell you?
                            <br />
                            Holmes is silent for a moment, then speaks.
                            <br />
                            - Watson, you're idiot, someone has stolen our tent.

                            <p>There was a boy who was always losing his temper.
                            His father gave him a bag full of nails and said to him, 
                            “My son, I want you to hammer a nail into our garden fence every time you need to direct your anger against something and you lose your temper.”
                            <br /><br />
                            So the son started to follow his father’s advice.
                            On the first day he hammered in 37 nails, but getting the nails into the fence was not easy, so he started trying to control himself when he got angry.
                            As the days went by, he was hammering in less nails, and within weeks he was able to control himself and was able to refrain from getting angry and from hammering nails.
                            He came to his father and told him what he had achieved.
                            His father was happy with his efforts and said to him: “But now, my son, you have to take out a nail for every day that you do not get angry.”
                            <br /><br />
                            The son started to take out the nails for each day that he did not get angry, until there were no nails left in the fence.
                            <br /><br />
                            He came to his father and told him what he had achieved.
                            His father took him to the fence and said, 
                            “My son, you have done well, but look at these holes in the fence.
                            This fence will never be the same again.”
                            Then he added: “When you say things in a state of anger, they leave marks like these holes on the hearts of others.
                            You can stab a person and withdraw the knife but it doesn’t matter how many times you say ‘I’m sorry,’ because the wound will remain.
